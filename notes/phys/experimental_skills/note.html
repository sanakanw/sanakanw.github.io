<h2 id="2.-investigating-scientific-questions">2. Investigating Scientific Questions</h2>

<h3 id="2.1-questioning-and-defining-a-purpose">2.1 Questioning and defining a purpose</h3>

<ul>
<li>Establish a <strong>research question</strong>

<ul>
<li>defines what is being investigated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once research question has been established, <strong>aim</strong> or <strong>purposes</strong> of
investigation can be laid out</li>
<li>Example</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How does the length of a wire affect its electrical resistance?</p>

<p><strong>Aim&#47;Purpose</strong>: To determine the effect of the length of a wire on its
electrical resistance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evaluate your research question using &#8220;SMART&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Specific?

<ul>
<li>Can it be reduced to question about relationship between two variables?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Measurable?

<ul>
<li>Can relevant variables be measured?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Achieveable?

<ul>
<li>Can research be completed safely, with knowledge, skills, equipment and time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relevant?

<ul>
<li>Is question related to area of study?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Testable?

<ul>
<li>Can you conduct an impartial investigation to answer it?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2.2-formulating-a-hypothesis">2.2 Formulating a hypothesis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aim of experimentation is to <strong>test ideas</strong></li>
<li>Tested by experiment to see if evidence to support them</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis</strong> - proposed answer to research question

<ul>
<li>existence or non-existence of relationship between two variables</li>
<li>written as an <strong>if-then statement</strong></li>
<li>state proposed cause, effect relationship between two variables</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If a wire is made longer, then its electrical resistance will increase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is a relationship between wire length and electrical resistance,
then its electrical resistance will increase as the wire is made longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is no effect of wire length on electrical resistance, then there
will ben o trend in the electrical resistance&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Hypotheses must be <strong>falsifiable</strong></li>
<li>Should be able to identify possible outcome of experiment which disproves
hypothesis</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider possible conclusions if any of the following were observed:- (a)
there was a clear positive trend between the wire length and resistance, or
(b) if there was no change in resistance, or [c] resistance fluctuated
randomly while the wire length was increased, but with no definite trend.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis not supported by experimental evidence should be <strong>rejected</strong></li>
<li>New hyopthesis to be proposed</li>
<li>Non-falisfiable hypothesis are not to be investigated by science</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2.3-designing-a-method-and-acounting-for-risk">2.3 Designing a method and acounting for risk</h3>

<p>A good method consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A careful consideration of variables</li>
<li>A series of logical steps in an order that they are to be done</li>
<li>Steps that begin with a command verb that clearly instructs the experimenter,
including what measurements are to be made and how</li>
<li>Specification of quantities and units</li>
<li>A diagram showing the set-up of the equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Scaffold to assess risk</p>

<h3 id="2.4-variables">2.4 Variables</h3>

<ul>
<li>Variables are factors in experiment that can change</li>
<li>Most experiments involve collection of <strong>bivariate data</strong></li>
<li>Aim to uncover cause-effect relationship between these variables</li>
<li>&#8220;causing&#8221; variable - <strong>independent variable</strong></li>
<li>&#8220;affected&#8221; variable - <strong>dependent variable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Controled variables</strong> - all other variables in experiment that must be held
constant as to not intefere</li>
<li><strong>experimental variable</strong> not to be confused with controlled variable

<ul>
<li>sample, trial or set up where <em>no changes</em> are made</li>
<li>purpose is to make sure that results are caused by test, not random occurences</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2.5-validity-reliability-and-accuracy">2.5 Validity, reliability and accuracy</h3>

<h4 id="2.5.1-validity">2.5.1 Validity</h4>

<ul>
<li>Method measures what was intended - direct relationship between independent
and dependent variable</li>
<li><strong>a. Are the controlled variables held constant?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Factors may influence result of experimeent and interfere with independent and
dependent variable relationship</li>
<li>All other variables must be held constant</li>
<li>This is called <strong>control of variables</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>b. Is the experiment reliable and accurate?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Reliability and accuracy also support validity</li>
<li>Inaccurate&#47;unreliable results could indicate variables are not controlled</li>
<li>Uncontrolled variables lead to random error - unreliability</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.5.2-reliability-and-precision">2.5.2 Reliability and precision</h4>

<ul>
<li>Yield consistent results when repeated under identical conditions</li>
<li><strong>a. Have there been repeated trials?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Measurements and experiments must be <strong>repeated</strong></li>
<li>Cannot be assessed from just one measurement or experiment</li>
<li><strong>Repetition does not improve reliability; only helps assess it</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>b. Are repeated trials consistent?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Results are clustered closely together</li>
<li>May be inconsistent due to random error</li>
<li><strong>Reducing level of random error</strong> in experiments make them more reliable</li>
<li>Can be quantified using concepts of <strong>spread</strong> and <strong>uncertainty</strong></li>
<li>Set of repeated measurements can be considered consistent if spread in set
of repeated trials (as measured by uncertainty) is lower than arbitrary
limit</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>c. <em>Precision</em> refers to how closely repeated measurements are clustered and
is specifically a form of <em>internal reliability</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.5.3-accuracy-and-error">2.5.3 Accuracy and error</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>a. What are the errors?</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> relates to how closely measurements are to <em>true</em> or
<em>theoretical</em> value</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong> is the difference between true value and measured value</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>b. Is the percentage error within a resonable limit?</strong>

<ul>
<li>\(\pm5\%\) for senior high school physics</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>c. What has been done to reduce error?</strong>

<ul>
<li>If no true value, accuracy can still be assessed by identify techniques used
to reduce error and commenting on effectiveness</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3.3-dealing-with-errors-and-uncertainties">3.3 Dealing with errors and uncertainties</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-error">What is error?</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>error</strong> is difference between measured and assumed &#8220;true&#8221; value

<ul>
<li>present in <em>every</em> measurement on some level</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sources of error include:

<ul>
<li>limitations on instruments -&#62; lack sensitivity or resolution may not be
sufficiently fine</li>
<li>enviornmental factors, e.g. noise</li>
<li>human limitations in making measurements -&#62; parallax, reaction time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quantifying-error">Quantifying error</h4>

<p>Error can be quantified using following equations:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type of error</th>
<th>Equation</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Absolute error</td>
<td>\(\|true\ value - measured\ value\|\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Relative error</td>
<td>\(\frac{\|true\ value - measured\ value\|}{true value}\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accuracy</td>
<td>\(100\%-percentage\ error\)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="systematic-and-random-errors">Systematic and random errors</h4>

<ul>
<li>Patterns will appear after multiple, repeated measurements have been made</li>
<li>Can be put into two categories depending on behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/error.png" alt="error" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Systematic errors</strong> - when measurements are repeated, values are <strong>displaced
in same direction</strong> from true value</li>
<li>Might measure consistently lower or higher from true value</li>
<li>Often caused by improperly calibrated measuring instruments, &#8220;zeroing&#8221; errors,
e.g. when scale shows non-zero reading when nothing on pan</li>
<li><strong>Random errors</strong> - when measurements are repeated, values are <strong>scattered
randomly</strong> above and below true value.</li>
<li>Caused by random fluctuations in ambient conditions or uncontrolled variables</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="improving-accuracy---reducing-errors">Improving accuracy - reducing errors</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>To increase accuracy, reduce errors</p></li>
<li><p>Can be done by making error smaller</p>

<ul>
<li>Relative to quantity</li>
<li>Absolutely</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>To reduce absolute error</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Using measuring instruments with appropriate resolution</li>
<li>Read analogue instruments directly front-on to reduce parallax</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>To reduce relative error</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Design experiments to increase size of measurements being made</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>To reduce systematic error</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that measuring instruments are properly calibrated and zeroed</li>
<li>Use linear regression to analyse data and consider meaning of y-intercept</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>To reduce random error</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Hold controlled variables constant</li>
<li>Conduct repeated trials of a measurement and compute average</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>Approximate</em> value with margin of uncertainty around it - within which the
&#8220;true&#8221; value could exist</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reporting-uncertainty">Reporting uncertainty</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Absolute uncertainty</strong> expressed in same units as measurements

<ul>
<li>e.g. mass of \(4.5\pm0.2kg\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Relative uncertainty</strong> expressed as percentage of measurement

<ul>
<li>e.g. mass of \(4.5kg\pm0.5\%\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uncertainty should be given to one significant figure

<ul>
<li>Measurement should be rounded to same number of decimal places as
uncertainty (more would be meaningless)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="estimating-uncertanties">Estimating uncertanties</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>a. Uncertainty in values read directly from measuring instrument</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>half of the smallest readable graduation on the scale of device</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>b. Uncertainty due to human factors</strong>

<ul>
<li>Use judgement to estimate uncertainty</li>
<li>e.g. height of bouncing ball cannot be read to nearest millimetre on ruler,
but could more reliably to <em>nearest 5 cm</em>.</li>
<li>Uncertainty would be \(\pm2.5cm\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>c. Uncertainty due to environmental factors</strong>

<ul>
<li>Halfway between upper and lower limits of <strong>fluctuation range</strong></li>
<li>\(\pm\frac{upper\ limit-lower\ limit}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>d. Uncertainty in average from series of repeated measurements</strong>

<ul>
<li>When calculated from repeated measurements, uncertainty is \(\pm1\ standard\
deviation\)</li>
<li>When few shortcuts, an appropriate short cut is to use <strong>half the range between highest and lowest measurements</strong></li>
<li>Many trials: \(\pm1\ standard\ deviation\)</li>
<li>Few trials: \(\pm\frac{highest\ trial-lowest\ trial}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
