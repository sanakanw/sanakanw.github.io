## 2. Investigating Scientific Questions

### 2.1 Questioning and defining a purpose
- Establish a **research question**
  - defines what is being investigated
- Once research question has been established, **aim** or **purposes** of
  investigation can be laid out
- Example

> **Question**: How does the length of a wire affect its electrical resistance?

> **Aim/Purpose**: To determine the effect of the length of a wire on its
> electrical resistance

Evaluate your research question using "SMART"

- Specific?
  - Can it be reduced to question about relationship between two variables?
- Measurable?
  - Can relevant variables be measured?
- Achieveable?
  - Can research be completed safely, with knowledge, skills, equipment and time
- Relevant?
  - Is question related to area of study?
- Testable?
  - Can you conduct an impartial investigation to answer it?


### 2.2 Formulating a hypothesis

- Aim of experimentation is to **test ideas**
- Tested by experiment to see if evidence to support them
- **Hypothesis** - proposed answer to research question
  - existence or non-existence of relationship between two variables
  - written as an **if-then statement**
  - state proposed cause, effect relationship between two variables

> "If a wire is made longer, then its electrical resistance will increase."

> "If there is a relationship between wire length and electrical resistance,
> then its electrical resistance will increase as the wire is made longer."

> "If there is no effect of wire length on electrical resistance, then there
> will ben o trend in the electrical resistance"

- Hypotheses must be **falsifiable**
- Should be able to identify possible outcome of experiment which disproves
  hypothesis

> Consider possible conclusions if any of the following were observed:- (a)
> there was a clear positive trend between the wire length and resistance, or
> (b) if there was no change in resistance, or [c] resistance fluctuated
> randomly while the wire length was increased, but with no definite trend.

- Hypothesis not supported by experimental evidence should be **rejected**
- New hyopthesis to be proposed
- Non-falisfiable hypothesis are not to be investigated by science

### 2.3 Designing a method and acounting for risk

A good method consists of:

- A careful consideration of variables
- A series of logical steps in an order that they are to be done
- Steps that begin with a command verb that clearly instructs the experimenter,
  including what measurements are to be made and how
- Specification of quantities and units
- A diagram showing the set-up of the equipment

Scaffold to assess risk

| Hazard  | Risk  | Control |
|---------|-------|---------|
| What are things that could harm you or the people around you? | What is the injury that could be sustained as a result of the hazard? | What precautions or procedures could you pit in place to reduce the level of risk? |

### 2.4 Variables

- Variables are factors in experiment that can change
- Most experiments involve collection of **bivariate data**
- Aim to uncover cause-effect relationship between these variables
- "causing" variable - **independent variable**
- "affected" variable - **dependent variable**
- **Controled variables** - all other variables in experiment that must be held
  constant as to not intefere
- **experimental variable** not to be confused with controlled variable
  - sample, trial or set up where *no changes* are made
  - purpose is to make sure that results are caused by test, not random occurences

### 2.5 Validity, reliability and accuracy

#### 2.5.1 Validity

- Method measures what was intended - direct relationship between independent
  and dependent variable
- **a. Are the controlled variables held constant?**
  - Factors may influence result of experimeent and interfere with independent and
    dependent variable relationship
  - All other variables must be held constant
    - This is called **control of variables**
- **b. Is the experiment reliable and accurate?**
  - Reliability and accuracy also support validity
  - Inaccurate/unreliable results could indicate variables are not controlled
  - Uncontrolled variables lead to random error - unreliability

#### 2.5.2 Reliability and precision

- Yield consistent results when repeated under identical conditions
- **a. Have there been repeated trials?**
  - Measurements and experiments must be **repeated**
  - Cannot be assessed from just one measurement or experiment
  - **Repetition does not improve reliability; only helps assess it**
- **b. Are repeated trials consistent?**
  - Results are clustered closely together
  - May be inconsistent due to random error
  - **Reducing level of random error** in experiments make them more reliable
  - Can be quantified using concepts of **spread** and **uncertainty**
  - Set of repeated measurements can be considered consistent if spread in set
    of repeated trials (as measured by uncertainty) is lower than arbitrary
    limit
- **c. _Precision_ refers to how closely repeated measurements are clustered and
  is specifically a form of _internal reliability_**

#### 2.5.3 Accuracy and error

- **a. What are the errors?**
  - **Accuracy** relates to how closely measurements are to *true* or
    *theoretical* value
  - **Error** is the difference between true value and measured value
- **b. Is the percentage error within a resonable limit?**
  - $\pm5\%$ for senior high school physics
- **c. What has been done to reduce error?**
  - If no true value, accuracy can still be assessed by identify techniques used
    to reduce error and commenting on effectiveness

### 3.3 Dealing with errors and uncertainties

#### What is error?

- **error** is difference between measured and assumed "true" value
  - present in *every* measurement on some level
- Sources of error include:
  - limitations on instruments -> lack sensitivity or resolution may not be
    sufficiently fine
  - enviornmental factors, e.g. noise
  - human limitations in making measurements -> parallax, reaction time

#### Quantifying error

Error can be quantified using following equations:

| Type of error  | Equation                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Absolute error | $\|true\ value - measured\ value\|$                    |
| Relative error | $\frac{\|true\ value - measured\ value\|}{true value}$ |
| Accuracy       | $100\%-percentage\ error$                              |

#### Systematic and random errors

- Patterns will appear after multiple, repeated measurements have been made
- Can be put into two categories depending on behaviour

![error](assets/error.png)

- **Systematic errors** - when measurements are repeated, values are **displaced
  in same direction** from true value
- Might measure consistently lower or higher from true value
- Often caused by improperly calibrated measuring instruments, "zeroing" errors,
  e.g. when scale shows non-zero reading when nothing on pan
- **Random errors** - when measurements are repeated, values are **scattered
  randomly** above and below true value.
- Caused by random fluctuations in ambient conditions or uncontrolled variables

#### Improving accuracy - reducing errors

- To increase accuracy, reduce errors
- Can be done by making error smaller
  - Relative to quantity
  - Absolutely

- *To reduce absolute error*
  - Using measuring instruments with appropriate resolution
  - Read analogue instruments directly front-on to reduce parallax
- *To reduce relative error*
  - Design experiments to increase size of measurements being made
- *To reduce systematic error*
  - Ensure that measuring instruments are properly calibrated and zeroed
  - Use linear regression to analyse data and consider meaning of y-intercept
- *To reduce random error*
  - Hold controlled variables constant
  - Conduct repeated trials of a measurement and compute average

#### Uncertainty

- *Approximate* value with margin of uncertainty around it - within which the
  "true" value could exist



#### Reporting uncertainty

- **Absolute uncertainty** expressed in same units as measurements
  - e.g. mass of $4.5\pm0.2kg$
- **Relative uncertainty** expressed as percentage of measurement
  - e.g. mass of $4.5kg\pm0.5\%$
- Uncertainty should be given to one significant figure
  - Measurement should be rounded to same number of decimal places as
    uncertainty (more would be meaningless)

#### Estimating uncertanties

- **a. Uncertainty in values read directly from measuring instrument**
  - **half of the smallest readable graduation on the scale of device**
- **b. Uncertainty due to human factors**
  - Use judgement to estimate uncertainty
  - e.g. height of bouncing ball cannot be read to nearest millimetre on ruler,
    but could more reliably to *nearest 5 cm*.
    - Uncertainty would be $\pm2.5cm$
- **c. Uncertainty due to environmental factors**
  - Halfway between upper and lower limits of **fluctuation range**
  - $\pm\frac{upper\ limit-lower\ limit}{2}$
- **d. Uncertainty in average from series of repeated measurements**
  - When calculated from repeated measurements, uncertainty is $\pm1\ standard\
    deviation$
  - When few shortcuts, an appropriate short cut is to use **half the range between highest and lowest measurements**
    - Many trials: $\pm1\ standard\ deviation$
    - Few trials: $\pm\frac{highest\ trial-lowest\ trial}{2}$
