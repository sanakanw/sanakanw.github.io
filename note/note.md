# Inter-War period: preparation and devlopments in Persia and Greece

## Themistocles becoming large political leader (493 BC)

- allowed for larger military in form of triremes
- created naval bases off phalerum
- generally encouraged athens to improve navy

## Power struggle athens (488BC - 482BC)

- intense power struggle for leadership between families
- themistocles and aristides
- ostraca, pieces of pottery found stratched with name of Themistocles dated to
  time
- Pultarch - Themistocles was astute politician who gained support of ordinary
  and "was always introducing sweeping reforms"

## Athens engaged in war with commercial rival Aegina (483-482BC)
- Aegina had most powerful navy in Greece until then
- After Themistocles gained political ground, got people to agree to build 100
  triremes by playing on their anger against Aeginetans
- Herodotus - "outbreak of this war at that moment saved Greece by forcing
  Athens to become a maritime power"
- Calum M. Carmichael (1990) - "Of all the public services, the naval [public
  office] ... was arguably the most important. It directly served the strategic
  and commercial interests of the state: the duties centered on the command and
  maintenance of the trireme warship for a year."
- Robin Waterfeld (2018) - development of many Triremes caused by tension
  between Athens and Agena

## Hellenic League

Hellenic League was formed 481-480 BC when Athens and Sparta called congresses
at Isthmus of Corinth to decide best way to defend Greece

- 31 states responded
- Northern states did not join not wanting to bear attack of initial Persian
  front
- Decisions made by Hellenic League
  - Themistocles - choose terrain to counter enourmous numbers (mountain passes,
    narrow straits)
  - Put aside fueds such as Athens and Aegina
  - Dispatch envoys to other cities to request help
  - Send spies fo Asia to asses Xerxess' strength
  - Advice from Delphi
  - Sparta appointed overall military and naval command

# Invasion of 480-479 BC: Battles of Thermopylae, Artemesium, Salamis, Plataea, Mycale

## Battle of Thermopylae
- Battle in 480 BCE in central Greece at mountain pass of Thermopylae
- Persian army defeated Greek forces led by Spartan King Leonidas
- However Spartans held Persians for 7 days
- Lost early due to Spartan traitor informing Persians of back flanking entrance
- Leonidas is seen as a noble warrior: "that shone so bright and sheene"
  (Stoneman, R + Lydgate, J)
- "Always, the Persians relied on massive numerical force to achieve their ends." (Stoneman, R)
- "Although it was a defeat for the Greek defenders, it had the crucial effect
  of delaying the Persian advance" (Stoneman, R)

## Battle of Artemisium

- Persian naval victory
- Greek held its own for three days of fighting but withdrew southward when news
  came of defeat at Thermopylae
- According to Herodotus Greeks had 271 Triremes at start of battle
- "It was an absolutely right judgement by Pindar that called the battle the
  cornerstone of Greek freedom" (Stoneman, R)


## Battle of Salamis

- Saronic Gulf
- Greeks had recently lost Battle of Thermopylae and withdraw naval Battle of
  Artemision
- Greeks won at Salamis
- Greatest most significant military victories in antiquity
- Overcame superior Persian numbers through daring tactics and sheer
  determination
- Green (1970) and Lazenby (1993) aruge that defending Isthmus was actually
  better plan
- Stoneman argues "It was Salamis that was to be the saviour of Greeks"

# Reasons for Greek Victory and Persian Defeat

## Themistocles' naval policy

- During 10 year period, suceeded through political maneuvering and statecrat in
  getting Athens to embark period of naval buildiup
- Herodotus

## Greek Unity

- Unification of all 31 states into Hellenic League allowed for combined
  strength
- Stronger single attacks rather than multiple weak attacks
- Battle of Plataea
  - Saw unification of Athenians and Spartan forces under command of Pausanius
  - Shows how they could work together when freedom was at stake
  - "It was by common effort that the foreign invader was repelled" - Thucydides
- "Battle of Plataea was finest achievement of Greek Unity" - Hammond

## Greek superior Weaponry and Armour

- Battle of Marathon and Plataea
  - Open plains good for hand to hand combat
  - **Greeks had**
    - Defensive armour
    - Bronze greaves
    - Hoplon shields
    - Iron spears and swords
    - Greeks fought in phalanx formation
  - **Persians had**
    - Little or no armour
    - Wicker shields useless against Greeks
- "Persian archery was alarmingly accurate" - Alan Lloyd
- "Ranks of the centre [of phalanx] were diminished" and "wings were made
  strong" - Herodotus"
Tom Holland places heavy emphasis on hoplite phalanx and effectiveness of its
shield formation and armour

## Persian Strategic Mistakes

- Neutralised numeral advantage made from higher command
- Xerxes had little experience of war
- Battle of Thermopylae
  - Narrow front bottle necked large Persian army population
- Battle of Salamis
  - Narrow fronts bottle necked large Persian population but now on water
- "The weakness [in the Persians] was in the higher command. The king had little
  experience of war"
- "The lessons of Marathon had not been learn" - Cook

## Greek Leadership

- Helped bring victory through morale boosting techniques
- "Fighting for their own freedom and independence" - Sanderson Beck
- Herodotus - Militades' leadership at Marathon in 490 BC boosted solderis'
  morale through ability to speak in public
    - "He delivered a stirring speech to tropps"

# Administration of Persian Empire

## Role of Satraps

- 26 satrapies
- Satraps represented king and were directly responsible to king
- Bigger and more important satrapies such as Babylon, Egypt and Lydia given to
  Royal princes
- Other less significant satrapies given to Persian Nobles
- Often hereditary
- Xenophon - States that military and civil were often separated
  - Military could stop excessive civil power, vise versa

## Economy

- Satraps were responsible for
  - Collecting tributes
  - Raising military levies
  - Dispensing justice
  - Had right to mint own silver coinage

# Revolts in the Empire

## Egypt

- 486 BC shortly before death of Darius
- Protest against heavy taxes imposed by Persians
- Possible Darius raised taxes to fund building program and invasion of Greece
- Following death of darius, Xerxes left to deal with revolt
- Revolt downplayed by Herodotus
- Xerxes' brother Achaemenes made satrap after revolt -> further subjegation of
  Egypt
- After quelling revolt, Xerxes did not continue to pay respect to Egyptian
  culture and customs

### Ancient Evidence

- "Xerxes laid all Egypt under a far harder yoke than even his father had put
  upon it, he gave the government to Achaemenes" - Herodotus
- Ahiqar scroll - trade flourished in Egypt during Xerxes' reign
- Book of Erza

### Modern views

- Burn - Rebellion broken in one campaign using army emassed for second Greek
  invasion
- Burn - Xerxes was brutal and interolant king
- Russel Granger - "The view that Xerxes treated Egypt hrashly after rebellion
  is not tenable"
  - "Evidence fro, such as the Ahiqar scroll demonstrates that trade flourished
    during Xerxes' reign"

## Babylon

- Xerxes' preparations for Greek campaign further delayed
- Grown disatisfied of Persian overlords afer 53 years

### Ancient Evidence

- Bel-Marduk statue
- Daiva inscription - Xerxes' authority and achievement in stopping revolts
- Herodotus - Removal of title 'King of babylon; from Xerxes' title and thus
  the end of Babylonian kingship
- Theft and melting down of golden Bel-Marduk, chief god of city of Babylon
  resulting in end of cult

### Modern Views

- Briant - Xerxes dealt with revolt swiftly
- Burn - Egypt and Babylon lost many privileges from revolt

# Religious Policy

# Zoroastrianism

- Vivedad
  - Worship of Persian/Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda
  - Deity woshipped by Achaemenid Kings
  - Viewed Ahura Mazda as supreme being and creator of verything
  - Zoroastrian burials reflected Persian values
- Stoneman - "The religion of Achamenid kings is controversial. Their tombs are
  adorned with the same figure of Ahura Mazda but he probably represents the
  kings' royal glory."
